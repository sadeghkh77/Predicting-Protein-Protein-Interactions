# Predicting-Protein-Protein-Interactions
This repository provides code to identify protein binding partners using ESM2, inspired by Hugging Face's approach to predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) effectively.
# Protein Binding Partners with ESM2

This repository provides a tool to predict protein binding partners using the ESM2 protein language model, based on the Hugging Face implementation. ESM2 offers state-of-the-art capabilities in protein sequence analysis, making it suitable for identifying potential interactions between proteins.

## Background

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are critical for understanding cellular mechanisms, signaling pathways, and immune responses. Identifying these interactions can assist in drug discovery and understanding disease mechanisms. This project utilizes the ESM2 model developed by Meta AI, a transformer-based protein language model, to predict PPIs based on protein sequences.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `transformers` library (by Hugging Face)
- `torch` for model computation
- Additional dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

To install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Clone the Repository
Download the code with:
git clone https://github.com/Sadeghkh77/protein-binding-partners
cd protein-binding-partners


Code Structure
predict_binding.py: Main script for predicting the likelihood of protein-protein interactions.
config.yaml: Configuration file with parameters for ESM2 model settings and sequence input configurations.
utils/: Directory containing helper functions for handling protein sequences, formatting input, and parsing output.
requirements.txt: List of all required packages for the project.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
Usage
Run the Prediction
To run the prediction, provide two protein sequences in the form of amino acid strings:
python predict_binding.py --protein1 <protein_sequence1> --protein2 <protein_sequence2>

Parameters
--protein1: Amino acid sequence for the first protein.
--protein2: Amino acid sequence for the second protein.
Configuration
The config.yaml file allows you to set various parameters for the model, including:

model_name: The specific model architecture to use (e.g., esm2_t33_650M_UR50D).
sequence_max_length: Maximum sequence length accepted by the model.
batch_size: Number of sequences processed in each batch.
output_type: Specifies the type of output generated (e.g., interaction score).
Adjust these settings based on your needs and computational resources.

Example Outputs
After running the script, the model outputs a score representing the likelihood of an interaction between the two input sequences. The output format is as follows:

plaintext
Copy code
Protein 1: <protein_sequence1>
Protein 2: <protein_sequence2>
Interaction Score: <score>
Higher scores indicate a stronger likelihood of interaction. Lower scores suggest little to no interaction between the sequences.

Example
For two sample sequences:

bash
Copy code
python predict_binding.py --protein1 "MKTIIALSYIFCLVFADYKDDDDK" --protein2 "MKTIIALSYIFCLVFADYKDDDDK"
Example output:

plaintext
Copy code
Protein 1: MKTIIALSYIFCLVFADYKDDDDK
Protein 2: MKTIIALSYIFCLVFADYKDDDDK
Interaction Score: 0.85
